## NOTED

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A simple note keeping mobile application

The project is divided into two parts- Backend and Frontend.

## **BACKEND: -**

![](RackMultipart20210810-4-2fglxk_html_a2dcccaf62b74ed1.jpg)The backend is built using NodeJS. Database used is MongoDB. A Rest API (CRUD) has been made which can post, delete, patch, and get data in the form of JSON. This is currently hosted on Heroku.

The authentication is done using Firebase through which users can login/register. Google signup option is also present.

Once the user logs in, he/she can start making notes. Notes can also be edited after their creation. There are different categories too like Work, Home, Favorite, and so on.

## **FRONTEND: -**

I have divided the dart screens into authentication and ui folders. Custom packages have been used for dialog boxes and loading screens, and so on. JSON parsing is also handled in this dart (Flutter) platform.
